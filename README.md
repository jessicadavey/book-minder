# Book Minder

[Book Minder](https://book-minder.herokuapp.com/)

An app that lets users keep track of books.  After selecting start and complete dates to an entry, the book automatically falls under **Currently Reading**, **Books I've Read**, or **Books I Want To Read**.

Data is stored in the user's local session.

Created as part of [Launch School](https://www.launchschool.com)'s RB175 Networked Applications course.
